  }
}
```

---

## Update Deployment

After making changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update FAQ bot"
git push
```

---

## Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, test these URLs:

- **Student View**: `https://your-app.railway.app`
- **Admin Panel**: `https://your-app.railway.app/admin`
- **API Test**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/faqs`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
Railway persists SQLite database. If you need to reset:
```bash
railway run rm sbo-faq.db
```

### Port Issues
Railway automatically sets PORT. Your app already uses `process.env.PORT || 3000` ‚úÖ

### Build Fails
Check logs:
```bash
railway logs
```

Common fixes:
- Make sure `package.json` has correct `"start": "node app.js"`
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check Node version: Railway uses Node 18+ ‚úÖ

---

## Current Status
‚úÖ Git repository initialized
‚úÖ All files committed
‚úÖ Railway CLI installed
‚è≥ Ready to deploy!

## Next Step

```bash

```
