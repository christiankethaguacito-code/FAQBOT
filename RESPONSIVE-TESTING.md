## ✅ What's Been Made Responsive

### Student FAQ Interface (`public/index.html`)
- **Mobile-first approach**: Designed for small screens, enhanced for larger ones
- **Fluid typography**: Text sizes scale smoothly with `clamp()`
- **Flexible layouts**: Grid systems adapt from 1 column to multi-column
- **Touch-friendly**: Buttons and inputs sized for finger taps (minimum 44px)
- **Adaptive spacing**: Padding and margins adjust based on screen size

### Admin Panel (`admin/index.html`)
- **Horizontal scrolling tables**: On mobile, tables scroll instead of breaking
- **Collapsible navigation**: Tab buttons stack or scroll on small screens
- **Responsive cards**: Stats grid adapts from 1 to 4 columns
- **Touch-optimized buttons**: Adequate spacing for mobile interaction
- **Modal adjustments**: Full-width on mobile, centered on desktop

## 🔍 Common Issues to Look For

### Text Issues
- ❌ Text cut off at screen edge
- ❌ Font too small to read on mobile
- ❌ Line height too tight
- ❌ Text overlapping other elements

### Layout Issues

## 🛠️ How to Fix Issues

### If text is too small:
Adjust `clamp()` values in CSS. Example:
```css
/* Before */
font-size: clamp(0.8rem, 2vw, 1rem);

/* After (larger minimum) */
font-size: clamp(0.9rem, 2vw, 1rem);
```

### If layout breaks on mobile:
Check for fixed widths. Replace with:
```css
/* Bad */
width: 600px;

/* Good */
max-width: 600px;
width: 100%;
```

### If buttons are too small:
Increase padding:
```css
button {
  padding: 0.875rem 1.5rem; /* At least 14px vertical */
  min-height: 44px; /* iOS minimum touch target */
}
```

### If elements overlap:
Add responsive breakpoint:
```css
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .element {
    margin-bottom: 1rem; /* Add space */
  }
}
```
